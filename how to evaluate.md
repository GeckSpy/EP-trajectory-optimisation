# What are we evaluating : 
- algorithms 
    - Q-learning
    - Deep-Q learning
    - Gen algo: classical + NEAT

# What are the key components :
- time complexity
    - statistique
    - time to reach goal (finding cars that do at least one lap)
    - play with hyperparameters
- power usage 
- parallelisation 
- memory usage
- For GA: Markov gen modelisation -> no possible mixing time
