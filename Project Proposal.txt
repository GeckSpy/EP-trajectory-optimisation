Our group for the project is: Mathieu Longatte, Louison Mocq and Mac√©o Ottavy

The main goal of ou project is to optimize a trajectory of a simple 2D car model in a turn using AI.

Obejctives:
  - Modeling : 
Modifying existing environment (and possibly creating our own) for our 2D car model using Gymnasium python package. If the other objectives are cleared, we could try to develop the model to optimize entire tracks. This would make us adapt our environment. We could also try to complexify our model or we could add new aspect like obstacles.

  - Using AI to find a trajectory as good as possible:
    - Implementing Q-learning algorithm which is a algorithm to train an AI.
    - Implementing Deep Q-learning with Pytorch python package.
  In both case, we will have to play with the parameters and the algorithm to make it as efficient as possible.

  - Train the AI in all the models and compare the result depending on the training times and the algorithm used (Q-learning VS Deep Q-learning)

  - Analys real trajectory of car racer to be able to compare the trajectories that our car make.

  - Evaluate our result with real best trajectory and trajectory that seems good
