Our group for the project is: Mathieu Longatte, Louison Mocq and Macéo Ottavy

The main goal of ou project is to optimize a trajectory of a simple 2D car model in a turn using AI.

Obejctives:
  - Modeling existing environment (and possibly creating our own) for our 2D car model using Gymnasium python package. If the other objectives are cleared, we could try to develop the model to optimize the trajectory of the car for an entire track. This would make us adapt our environment. We could also try to complexify our model or we could add new aspect like obstacles.

  - Using AI to find a trajectory as good as possible:
    - Implementing Q-learning algorithm which is a algorithm to train an AI.
    - Implementing Deep Q-learning with Pytorch python package.
    - May be implenting other algorithms that we found.
  In both case, we will have to play with the parameters and the algorithm to make it as efficient as possible.

  - Train the AI in all the models and compare the result depending on the training times and the algorithm used (Q-learning VS Deep Q-learning VS other algorithm and/or more basic one)

  - Analys real trajectory of car racer to be able to compare the trajectories that our car make. We could compare our different models.

  - Evaluate our result with real best trajectory and trajectory that seems good.

  - If we succeed to have good result on those previous objectives and if we still have enough time, we could try to optimize a far muxh harder things: the decision of ou AI to be able to find good trajectories for random turns or random tracks. Then, we would have to rebuild entierly our environment and try to make heuristics or decision to solve our problem.
