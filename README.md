why Q-learning converges ?  http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~mtjspaan/readingGroup/ProofQlearning.pdf

How do we do mathematical modeling ?
We don't have like precise idea on how the algorithms will behave, But we can give informal predictions on the convergences depending on the parameters based on the litterature on 
Q-learning algorithms , hyperparameters study (nb of epochs, batch_size, learning rate , depth of the network).
